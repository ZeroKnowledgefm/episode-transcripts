This week, I chat with Ayush from zkEmail. We catchup on the project, and Ayush shares the different ways in which the zkEmail protocol is being used in the wild. If you remember zkemail is a system by which you can use zk  to prove that you have received a specific email and things about the content of that email. While the concept is quite simple, the ways in which it has been applied have been really interesting. Zk email can act as a bridge between web2 systems, like venmo, google, and social media accounts and web3 systems, like payment rails, account management. It has recently used by existing wallets to provide account recovery, it has been used to allow for anonymous chat with proven reputation, as well as proving digital provenance and more. 
This was an exploration of novel zk usecases, one of my favorite topics to cover, so hope you enjoy! 


Before we kick off,


I do want to just let you know about the zkSummit. zkSummit13 is coming up. It's happening on May 12th in Toronto. This is the second time we bring the zkSummit to North America, the first being back in 2019 when we did one in San Francisco. If you've never been to a zkSummit, I definitely recommend checking it out. This is the spot to find out about the latest research, the newest applications, to find out who are the most important players in ZK today. It's also a wonderful way to get to know sort of the larger ZK community. The application to attend is now open. So do get your application in early and we'll get in touch with you very shortly. Links, as always, are in the show notes and I hope to see you there.
 








proteus.photos is out of date (totally optional, also fine just taking it spontaneously):
Proteus is an open-source platform for AI content provenance, leveraging perceptual hashing, digital signatures, and MPC/FHE to create incorruptible, private, and robust watermarks.
- DinoHash: Perceptual hashing algorithm robust to common image transformations like filters, compression and crops. Algorithm achieves 12% higher bit accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Perceptual hash values are signed by the content generator, establishing provenance. This is *not* a cryptographic hash.
- Privacy-Preserving Queries: Multi-Party Fully Homomorphic Encryption to map image provenance, keeps both user queries and registry data private, with a fallback to MPC if the database is too large.
- Failsafe Detection: Backup classifier identifies synthetic images not found in the registry with state of the art accuracy, showing 25% better classification accuracy on real-world AI generators. This is pure model training.
- Adversarial Defense: Protection against both hash collision and hash aversion attacks, that limit the attack surface wherein an attacker cannot modify the provenance without visually changing the image (at least in our tests).

Title: Making ZK More Human with Aayush from ZK Email


Description:


This week Anna catches up with Aayush Gupta from ZK Email, covering the latest developments and real-world applications of the ZK Email protocol. They explore how the project serves as a bridge between Web2 systems and Web3 infrastructure and go on to discuss use cases like wallet-based account recovery, anonymous reputation-based communication, and digital provenance verification. This was an exploration of novel ZK use cases, which is something we love to cover - so we hope you enjoy it!

In this week’s episode, Anna (https://twitter.com/annarrose) and Kobi(https://x.com/kobigurk) chat with Muthu Venkitasubramaniam (https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/muthuv/) and Carmit Hazay (https://www.eng.biu.ac.il/hazay/) from Ligero (https://ligero-inc.com). They discuss their work on MPC and ZK for the last 20 years and how the research has evolved. They then dive into a nuanced conversation on how MPC & ZK are interrelated. The discuss Ligero, what led to the project and the early phases, as well as the new Ligetron (https://ligetron.com/) system and how they plan on getting this technology into the wild.
